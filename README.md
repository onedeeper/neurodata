Analysis of EEG signals.

Project involved cleaning, transforming and analyzing EGG data collected during a language perception experiment. 

This project analyzes EEG data to study how rhythm influences language processing, specifically in resolving sentence ambiguity. Participants in three groups (German monolinguals, Turkish early learners, and Turkish late learners of German) listened to sentences with regular and irregular rhythms. EEG data from 59 electrodes was recorded to observe brain activity, focusing on theta-band (4-8 Hz) power differences between ambiguous and non-ambiguous sentences. Results showed no significant differences in key brain regions, suggesting that rhythm may not play a role in processing sentence ambiguity for late German learners. Insights gained may support advancements in brain-computer interfaces and cognitive rehabilitation tools.
